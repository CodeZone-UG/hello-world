# hello-world
#CodeZone</> is a non-profit organization where volunteer Geeks in Uganda inspire & mentor University freshmen in the Computing world (particularly in Code).
We believe in a world where everyone can read and write code.

Our Mission is to assist each other through our academic and/or professional journey as we virtually and where possible physically share knowledge and resources in a relatively free, relaxed and exciting manner in order to empower the next generation of Developers that love their career. We do that, by creating educational programs and providing necessary resources in underprivileged areas.

We are currently relying entirely on an amazing team of young volunteers.
